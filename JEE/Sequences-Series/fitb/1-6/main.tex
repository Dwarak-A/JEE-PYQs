	    \item  The solution of the equation                                    
		    ${\log_{7}\log_{5}(\sqrt{x+5}+\sqrt{x})}$ \hfill{(1986-2 Marks)}
     
     
	     \item The sum of the first $n$ terms of the series ${1^2+2.2^2+3^2+2.4^2+5^2+2.6^2+\dots}$ is
   ${n (n+1)^2 /2}$, when $n$ is even. When $n$ is odd, the sum 
   is\dots\hfill{(1988-2 Marks)}
        
          
		  \item Let the harmonic mean and geometric mean of two positive numbers be the ratio $4:5$. Then the two numbers are in 
			  ratio\dots\hfill{(1992-2 Marks)}
          
     
		  \item For any odd integer $n \ge 1$, ${n^3-(n-1)^3+(-1)^{n-1} 1^3=\dots}$\hfill{(1996-1 Mark)}
       
     
		  \item  Let $p$ and $q$ be the roots of the equation                    ${x^2-2x+A=0}$ and $r$ and $s$ be the roots of the                     equation${x^2-18x+B=0}$.If ${p<q<r<s}$ are                                      in arithmetic progression,then A=\dots and B=\dots\hfill{(1977-2 Marks)}
